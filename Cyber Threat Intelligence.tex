\section*{Summary}

Bob Stasio, Senior Product Manager for Cyber Analysis at IBM i2 Safer Planet, shared his knowledge and experience in the field of Cyber Threat and Analysis on 10\textsuperscript{th} February , 2016. \\

Being part of many global financial firms like Bloomberg, he gave the example of FIN4, a group responsible for getting insider information for stock trading. This group fetched email login credentials of some individuals who were known to have confidential information. Using the information from these individuals they traded on the financial markets to make approximately \$100 million. \\

The speaker also spoke of the most recent $35 million attack on Sony. According to the speaker, the attackers were present in the Sony's network for a number of months in order to successfully break it. The attackers made multiple attempts to break the system. Each failed attempt taught the attackers where they were going wrong. So, they made appropriate changes for their next attempt and eventually breaking the system. \\

Speaking on Cyber Attacks, he mentions that 80\% of the attacks can be successfully blocked by taking small precautions, but it is the remaining 20\% are the most difficult one's to block. The four points to consider for Cyber Security are as follows :
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Finding the Hidden Threats in a Network
\item Finding the anomalies in the network.
\item Analyzing the anomalies and their relations with each other.
\item Understanding the implication of each anomaly and mitigating the attack. \\
\end{enumerate} 

So,In order to provide Cyber Security, Cyber Analysis is of utmost importance. Cyber Analysis can be broken down into 3 parts as mentioned below.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{ Information Security} : which deals with ensuring safety of data using various methods. Protecting the data from malware  to ensure confidentiality.
\item \textbf{ Forensic Science} : which deals with gathering and processing appropriate information to form evidence.
\item \textbf{ Intelligence Analysis} :  which deals with processing the gathered information in order to take appropriate decisions. It deals with collecting, processing, analyzing and distributing of appropriate data. \\
\end{enumerate}

The speaker concluded by saying that one can never master all the three sub divisions of Cyber Analysis but we can always start with one of them. Being from a non-military background, mastering Intelligence Analysis can be a difficult task but Information Security and Forensic Science are available for civilians.
